# Term Project for CPSC 321

## Problem 1 - Create CFFS Disk Simulator

> To test the shell, type the keywords ```disk_write``` and ```disk_read``` to write a block of data to the 'disk' and then return that block of data and write the hex values to console.

Any feedback on the implementation so far is greatly appreciated :)
