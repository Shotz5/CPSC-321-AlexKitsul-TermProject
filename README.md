# Term Project for CPSC 321

> This is not my finest work. I did not find a good method to do the assignment until it was almost too late. I've implmented up to the end of question 2 with the ```make_file``` ```write_file``` and ```delete_file``` commands. To use, run `./compile.sh` and then type `./Binaries/main` while in the src file. This program mostly assumes correct input (plus or minus too many files), and does put correct information in to RAM.

> Usage is ```make_file```, ```write_file [text] [inodeindex]```, and ```delete_file [inodeindex]```.

> There is no way to retreive the data once it's been written. The project documentation did not state this was a requirement.

> There is no working directory system. Unfortunately I did not have the time to implement it.
